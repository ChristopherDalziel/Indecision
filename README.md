# Indecision App

### Put your decisions in the hands of a computer

Enter your choices and have the computer make a random decision for you!

Careful though.. the computers decision is final.

I intend to take this basic REACT application and build on it from here my goals include:

- @Styled components && Styling
- Separated components
- Testing via Jest or React-Testing-Library (80%+ Coverage)

# Wireframes

#### Homepage

Here I would like to display a bold header, and a big choice input bar, as well as displaying each choice as they're entered by the user.

#### Computer answer page

Upon submission your result page scrolls down to display your answer

#### Computer answer page stretch goal

This wouldn't make the logic etc behind my application that much more complex this would be more of a stretch goal to push my CSS/Styling/Animation abilities.

# Starting point

Humble beginnings of the basic application, displaying 3 choices as well as the basic alert received when it's submitted.
