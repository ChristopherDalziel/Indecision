# Indecision App

### Put your decisions in the hands of a computer

Enter your choices and have the computer make a random decision for you!

Careful though.. the computers decision is final.

I intend to take this basic REACT application and build on it from here my goals include:

- @Styled components && Styling
- Separated components
- Testing via Jest or React-Testing-Library (80%+ Coverage)
